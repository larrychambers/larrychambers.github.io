<b>What People Say About Larry Chambers</b>
</center><br><br>


<b>“</b>Wow! I loved the book idea.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it. I love how you intend to get your point across with the lives of the women.... just excellent.
You know what's funny, is I don't necessarily look at being a woman as a 
disadvantage (especially in my market: divorce).  However, when I was 
younger, and a size 4, I used to cold call city managers, mayors, etc. marketing 457 plans.... I got in the door every time.  Loved it Larry, loved it. I am humbly, your #1 fan! <b>Carol</b> 


<b>“</b>Larry Chambers’ First Time Investor books offer real-world investment applications in an understandable way” <b>Jack Canfield,</b> Chicken Soup for the Soul, #1 New York Times bestseller.<br><br>

<b>“</b>I made Larry Chambers book mandatory reading for my Ranger team. I’d quiz my men about what they’d learned; to be bold, daring, tenacious, audacious, and don’t be afraid to make a decision. We went from the worst platoon in the regiment to the best platoon in six months.  In training we’d get to objective so fast they had to hold us back. This book made a difference.” <b> MSG (ret) H. "Mad Max" Mullen </b> 75th Ranger Regiment, Ranger course instructor <br><br>

<b>“</b>Larry - The VA group loved your book. The literary types liked the last couple of lines you wrote about the ancient Roman soldiers living away from the city for the first couple of years back. The room got quiet when they talked about that. Everyone recalled their favorite moments in your book, favorite stories, and everybody commented on the humor and detail you provided. I told them the story your story about Univ of Utah and the kind Dean.  The group actually ran over 30 minutes – that’s a lot of time to stay after work for a group of people who just finished working 8-10 hour shifts.<br><br> 

I’m glad a bunch of VA staff (nurses, counselors, psychiatrists, admin people, computer people, etc.) got to read and talk about Recondo and its author, Larry Chambers! <b>Richard C. Katz</b>, Ph.D., CCC-SLP, BC-NCD, is the Chief, Audiology and Speech Pathology Service, Phoenix VA Health Care System, and Adjunct Professor, Arizona State University, Tempe Az. 

<b>“</b>The book is REALLY good larry; my mother that is a VORACIOUS reader like me and who taught me to read said this Below (mind you my Mother god bless her would come up with ANY reason to say it sucked if it did:<br><br> 

"I am really digging this. . . Taking the Heroes Journey and it with the investors self- inventory is quite brilliant. I am only through one third of the book - seems a worthy contribution to this economic conversation that is full of wildly differing lenses. It feels almost holy. I would offer<br><br>  

one idea. . . There are places where the royal "we" could be used instead of 'I" and there are places where I is crucial. Perhaps you might figure out where it becomes more impactful to use this? At any rate, WOW."

<b>“</b>Perhaps it’s no surprise that Larry Chambers is a big fan of the written word, since he’s authored some 40 books (not all under his own name) and close to 2,000 magazine articles. He believes that an advisor who becomes “a local celebrity, even on a simple topic” by writing pieces for a local newspaper or a trade magazine will reap benefits in two ways: the process of researching, writing, and editing the articles will help you focus on what you know and what you can offer clients; and the articles will continue to serve as marketing vehicles for years to come.
As for marketing mistakes, the biggest one, he says, “is to do nothing” and think that the flow of passive referrals common in the go-go I 990s will return. “You have to have a proactive marketing process,” he counsels, and you have to be persistent if you want to be recognized as an expert<b> —James J. Green Editor</b>& Chief Investment Advisor<br><br>


<b>“</b>Larry, You are an inspiration to me -- it is a rare person who has the courage to toss out long-held convictions. I admire you for not staying stuck in identities that you've outgrown, and for having the bravery to follow your true path wherever it leads you. This stuff you are finding out is really interesting -- and a lot of it I am learning for the first time from you. <b>Mayo Morley</b><br><br>

<b>“</b>Larry, I don't know exactly what to say.  A heartfelt quest for closure in events that shaped and dominated a life?  Bravo.  Being pure and true to your feelings is noble, just and to be highly admired.  You have always followed your heart and it has served you well, in my opinion.  Perhaps closure is not as important as wisdom and fulfilling purpose.  You think and act with a purity like no other I have ever known and that is cherished. With respect and warmth, <b>Curt Dudnick</b><br><br>

<b>“</b>Larry, Last night I drove home and thanked God for our meeting yesterday! It’s been a long time since I’ve met someone that I “look up too.”  I have YOU to thank for that! I’ll never forget the impact of our meeting last night! As far as my rage towards Backwater, Halliburton and KBR, etc…you are right…I need to let it go and focus on myself above all.  I realize that I can’t erase things form my memory but there is balance to everything and that’s what I’m looking for!<b> Brandon</b><br><br> 

<b>“</b>Thanks, Larry. Your message is healing. I don't think it's ever easy to share in public, but as you say, exposure helps get rid of the negative charge around shame. Please keep me posted on your public presentations. I know you'll be at Ojai WordFest soon and I'm hoping my husband can hear you speak then.<br><br>

Many thanks for all the good work that you do, 
<h><b><h1>Carolyn Moore Ojai, CA</h1></b>

<b>“</b>Mr. Chambers, Every once in a while there’s a great article from the many trade magazines we get here, as was your recent article, “Fear Is Not A Growth Strategy”. You included some great facts and some great ideas. They’re many things in the article that I’ll do tonight so that we’ll begin to implement tomorrow.  In particular, I like the idea of tribes of people and how advisors seem to appear the same to the general public. <b>Kelli Waller CFA</b><br><br> 

<b>“</b>I loved Recondo and have added it to my special collection, which is why I tracked you down to ask for a signature. You did an incredible job of transporting me to Vietnam; it was like I was on patrol with you. It was one of those rare books that I just couldn’t put down and hated to finish. <b>Kevin Basnight</b><br><br>  

<b>“</b>Larry; I don’t know why other people hire you —But, I think the core reason I hire you is that you empower me and I always feel better about myself, my life, and my prospects after talking to you. I am not sure how you market that but I would argue that ability is far more important than teaching someone the mechanics of attraction marketing. Please understand that I am not denigrating attraction marketing. Rather, lam suggesting that your ability to empower is at the very heart of teaching someone how to do attraction marketing. Phrased another way — I think you have a unique ability to help people discover what about them can be made attractive. <b> J. Wayne Firebaugh Jr., CPA, CFP</b><br><br>

<b>“</b>Amazing! It’s rare that people who actually do things worth writing about actually write about them, and even rarer that they write about them well and usefully. My first writing teacher — the novelist Joyce Carol Oates — used to opine that this was the case because people who did things didn’t need to write about them. In any case, I’m very glad to have read it, and very glad to know you. One of my great regrets is that I never went into the service — knew how hard it would be, and academia is much easier, even though it frequently goes against my grain.
Thank you very much, <b> Pinckney Iowa Writers Professor</b><br><br>  

<b>“</b>Dear Mr. Chambers  I read all of your books. I just couldn’t believe you got back to me. For me it was like getting reply from Superman. I was raised on stories about Vietnam War and Army Rangers. Poland has always fought against communists, first in WWI than before WWII in 1939 and shortly after the war. There were some guerrilla forces fighting against Soviet Militia and NKVD. In 1956 there was a mutiny in Radom, hundreds of people got on the streets and fought hard against the government. In 1970 there were mutinies in Gdansk, Gdynia, Katowice and other cities. Many civilians died on the streets of Poland. In 1980 Soviet tanks were standing all over Poland,<br><br>

soldiers everywhere. It was like Northern Ireland here.  I will do whatever I can to make sure that people will not forget about you guys. Regards

<b>“</b>Chambers talks of high productivity manufacturing technology spreading throughout the world wrote the led story for January 1990 issue of Pension Asia, and companies operating on a global scale relentless global competition  and increases in real world output. All of that leads Chambers to suggest a future that holds a 5,000 Dow and 5 percent interest rates.   <b>Ed LaBorwit </b>Editor-in-Chief Pension World 1990<br><br>

<b>“</b>We began 2000 with approximately $1.9 billion in assets under management.  By 2005, that figure had grown to $11 billion and one year later we reached 20 billion.  Our marketing theme at Thornburg is to build product visibility, primarily by demonstrating value by educating advisors. We are a small mutual fund company located in Santa Fe, New Mexico, who has the same visibility of a much larger organization.  We have accomplished this by combining our internal marketing department and The Larry Chambers’ Credibility Marketing Program —writing articles and books directed to educate our market. I believe this is the secret to growth.

 <b>“</b>One of the most valuable experiences I’ve had in my professional life was to slow down, step back, and chart exactly where I am, where I’m going, what tools , techniques and processes I’m going to use to get there—and then lay it over a timeline: one year, three years, five years, 25 years, and life.  Without Larry’s help, I never would have taken the time to stop, think about it, map it and implement it—the conclusion of which is my book, Surviving the Storm, now in worldwide release. 
 <b>James O. Lunney</b>, Linsco/Private Ledger (LPL) Denver, CO<br><br>

<b>“</b>We started a brand new company and turned to the author to help us get our name known in the industry.  Within two years, Lockwood Financial Group became a brand name in the money management industry.  A big part of our success is due to Larry’s efforts and the use of Larry’s strategies to publicize our firm.”
<b>Len Reinhart, CEO and Chairman of Lockwood Financial Group</b><br><br>

<b>“</b>We estimate that The Larry Chambers Company’s marketing program accounted for an additional $15 million dollars of value to our firm. In fact, the company that bought us was outside the United States and had found us by reading one our articles. Enough said. <b>John Bowen President</b> CEG Worldwide 
“We’ve picked up 50% more clients with three times the average account size after writing a series of article and a book, Building a World –Class Financial Service.<br><br> 

Business, Dearborn Trade. I now have visibility and expert status recognition and today I’m solicited to give keynote speeches to prospects and clients.  It’s a marketing process that works.”   <b>-Don Schreiber</b> president and CEO of Wealth Builders Inc., a Registered Investment Advisory firm<br><br> 

<b>“</b>I've worked with Larry since my days as an editor at Financial Planning magazine in the mid-80s. I continued to work with him over the next 20 years or so, as a freelance writer when I went to Worth magazine and Dow Jones Investment Advisor. I've recommended Larry for numerous writing/consulting engagements such as with Thornburg Investment Management (where my marriage to one of Thornburg's partners disqualified me). Larry co-authored a number of books and articles for them, including the still highly regarded "Thornburg Guide to ERISA." He's a fine writer, whose real strength is a thorough understanding of the financial services industry and where various companies, products, and players fit into it. Larry's used this expertise to write and publish more than 50 books for his clients over the years. For senior corporate executives looking to brand their expertise and create substantial publicity while doing it, there's no better partner in the business than Larry Chambers. 
<b>Bob Clark Former editor - Chief Worth Magazine</b><br><br>  

<b>“</b>Larry was responsible for the placement of over 40 articles with me while at AEGON and TIAA-CREF which resulted in over 100 quotes in other articles and books.  His work led to the cover story of Financial Planning about the work we were doing at TIAA-CREF to develop the advisor business.  If you Google Michael Lane AEGON or Michael Lane TIAA-CREF most of the articles you will view were a result of Larry managing relationships on our behalf with industry media.  Larry has the ability to not just help in article writing and placement, but also direct media people to who they should speak with for quotes which created an image in the market, in less than 2 years, that AEGON was the thought leader in the annuity industry.  That has since waned… after I left and they went back to traditional advertising and marketing. 
<b>-Michael F.</b> Lane Vice-President Dimensional Fund Advisors<br><br> 

<b>“</b>Larry Chambers is the secret weapon behind many of the most successful financial service companies in North America. <b>-Steve Moeller</b> President and CEO, American Business Visions<br><br> 
 
<b>“</b>Larry Chambers has skillfully mastered the art of PR.  His book, just like his articles, captures the true essence of what any professional needs to know to be successful in the area of public relations.
