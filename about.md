<b>What People Say About Larry Chambers</b>
</center><br><br>


<b>“</b>Wow! I loved the book idea.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it. I love how you intend to get your point across with the lives of the women.... just excellent.
You know what's funny, is I don't necessarily look at being a woman as a 
disadvantage (especially in my market: divorce).  However, when I was 
younger, and a size 4, I used to cold call city managers, mayors, etc. marketing 457 plans.... I got in the door every time.  Loved it Larry, loved it. I am humbly, your #1 fan! <b>Carol</b> 


<b>“</b>Larry Chambers’ First Time Investor books offer real-world investment applications in an understandable way” <b>Jack Canfield,</b> Chicken Soup for the Soul, #1 New York Times bestseller.<br><br>

<b>“</b>I made Larry Chambers book mandatory reading for my Ranger team. I’d quiz my men about what they’d learned; to be bold, daring, tenacious, audacious, and don’t be afraid to make a decision. We went from the worst platoon in the regiment to the best platoon in six months.  In training we’d get to objective so fast they had to hold us back. This book made a difference.” <b> MSG (ret) H. "Mad Max" Mullen </b> 75th Ranger Regiment, Ranger course instructor <br><br>

<b>“</b>Larry - The VA group loved your book. The literary types liked the last couple of lines you wrote about the ancient Roman soldiers living away from the city for the first couple of years back. The room got quiet when they talked about that. Everyone recalled their favorite moments in your book, favorite stories, and everybody commented on the humor and detail you provided. I told them the story your story about Univ of Utah and the kind Dean.  The group actually ran over 30 minutes – that’s a lot of time to stay after work for a group of people who just finished working 8-10 hour shifts.<br><br> 

I’m glad a bunch of VA staff (nurses, counselors, psychiatrists, admin people, computer people, etc.) got to read and talk about Recondo and its author, Larry Chambers! <b>Richard C. Katz</b>, Ph.D., CCC-SLP, BC-NCD, is the Chief, Audiology and Speech Pathology Service, Phoenix VA Health Care System, and Adjunct Professor, Arizona State University, Tempe Az. 

<b>“</b>The book is REALLY good larry; my mother that is a VORACIOUS reader like me and who taught me to read said this Below (mind you my Mother god bless her would come up with ANY reason to say it sucked if it did:<br><br> 

"I am really digging this. . . Taking the Heroes Journey and it with the investors self- inventory is quite brilliant. I am only through one third of the book - seems a worthy contribution to this economic conversation that is full of wildly differing lenses. It feels almost holy. I would offer<br><br>  

one idea. . . There are places where the royal "we" could be used instead of 'I" and there are places where I is crucial. Perhaps you might figure out where it becomes more impactful to use this? At any rate, WOW."

    “There's a real story here for everybody."            
    "Larry, you participated in a national tragedy.  You could define the American experience in the 20th century by the Vietnam War and the splits in this country that it brought to the surface.  Nothing since the Civil War has split this country apart more in terms of brother against brother, mother against son, father against son.  And you were an integral part of that experience.  
    “Then there are the guys like me – the peacenik draft dodgers, protesting the war and getting laid while or guys like you –where out there killing commies in Vietnam...  But here we are forty years later and appreciating each other's experience and even laughing about them.
