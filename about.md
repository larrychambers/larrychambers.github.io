<b>What People Say About Larry Chambers</b>
</center><br><br>


<b>“</b>Wow! I loved the book idea.  Loved it.  Loved it.  Loved it. I love how you intend to get your point across with the lives of the women.... just excellent.
You know what's funny, is I don't necessarily look at being a woman as a 
disadvantage (especially in my market: divorce).  However, when I was 
younger, and a size 4, I used to cold call city managers, mayors, etc. marketing 457 plans.... I got in the door every time.  Loved it Larry, loved it. I am humbly, your #1 fan! <b>Carol</b> 


<b>“</b>Larry Chambers’ First Time Investor books offer real-world investment applications in an understandable way” <b>Jack Canfield,</b> Chicken Soup for the Soul, #1 New York Times bestseller.<br><br>

<b>“</b>I made Larry Chambers book mandatory reading for my Ranger team. I’d quiz my men about what they’d learned; to be bold, daring, tenacious, audacious, and don’t be afraid to make a decision. We went from the worst platoon in the regiment to the best platoon in six months.  In training we’d get to objective so fast they had to hold us back. This book made a difference.” <b> MSG (ret) H. "Mad Max" Mullen </b> 75th Ranger Regiment, Ranger course instructor <br><br>

<b>“</b>Larry - The VA group loved your book. The literary types liked the last couple of lines you wrote about the ancient Roman soldiers living away from the city for the first couple of years back. The room got quiet when they talked about that. Everyone recalled their favorite moments in your book, favorite stories, and everybody commented on the humor and detail you provided. I told them the story your story about Univ of Utah and the kind Dean.  The group actually ran over 30 minutes – that’s a lot of time to stay after work for a group of people who just finished working 8-10 hour shifts.<br><br> 

I’m glad a bunch of VA staff (nurses, counselors, psychiatrists, admin people, computer people, etc.) got to read and talk about Recondo and its author, Larry Chambers! <b>Richard C. Katz</b>, Ph.D., CCC-SLP, BC-NCD, is the Chief, Audiology and Speech Pathology Service, Phoenix VA Health Care System, and Adjunct Professor, Arizona State University, Tempe Az. 

<b>“</b>The book is REALLY good larry; my mother that is a VORACIOUS reader like me and who taught me to read said this Below (mind you my Mother god bless her would come up with ANY reason to say it sucked if it did:<br><br> 

"I am really digging this. . . Taking the Heroes Journey and it with the investors self- inventory is quite brilliant. I am only through one third of the book - seems a worthy contribution to this economic conversation that is full of wildly differing lenses. It feels almost holy. I would offer<br><br>  

one idea. . . There are places where the royal "we" could be used instead of 'I" and there are places where I is crucial. Perhaps you might figure out where it becomes more impactful to use this? At any rate, WOW."

<b>“</b>Perhaps it’s no surprise that Larry Chambers is a big fan of the written word, since he’s authored some 40 books (not all under his own name) and close to 2,000 magazine articles. He believes that an advisor who becomes “a local celebrity, even on a simple topic” by writing pieces for a local newspaper or a trade magazine will reap benefits in two ways: the process of researching, writing, and editing the articles will help you focus on what you know and what you can offer clients; and the articles will continue to serve as marketing vehicles for years to come.
As for marketing mistakes, the biggest one, he says, “is to do nothing” and think that the flow of passive referrals common in the go-go I 990s will return. “You have to have a proactive marketing process,” he counsels, and you have to be persistent if you want to be recognized as an expert<b> —James J. Green Editor</b>& Chief Investment Advisor<br><br>


<b>“</b>Larry, You are an inspiration to me -- it is a rare person who has the courage to toss out long-held convictions. I admire you for not staying stuck in identities that you've outgrown, and for having the bravery to follow your true path wherever it leads you. This stuff you are finding out is really interesting -- and a lot of it I am learning for the first time from you. <b>Mayo Morley</b><br><br>

<b>“</b>Larry, I don't know exactly what to say.  A heartfelt quest for closure in events that shaped and dominated a life?  Bravo.  Being pure and true to your feelings is noble, just and to be highly admired.  You have always followed your heart and it has served you well, in my opinion.  Perhaps closure is not as important as wisdom and fulfilling purpose.  You think and act with a purity like no other I have ever known and that is cherished. With respect and warmth, <b>Curt Dudnick</b><br><br>

<b>“</b>Larry, Last night I drove home and thanked God for our meeting yesterday! It’s been a long time since I’ve met someone that I “look up too.”  I have YOU to thank for that! I’ll never forget the impact of our meeting last night! As far as my rage towards Backwater, Halliburton and KBR, etc…you are right…I need to let it go and focus on myself above all.  I realize that I can’t erase things form my memory but there is balance to everything and that’s what I’m looking for!<b> Brandon</b><br><br> 

<b>“</b>Thanks, Larry. Your message is healing. I don't think it's ever easy to share in public, but as you say, exposure helps get rid of the negative charge around shame. Please keep me posted on your public presentations. I know you'll be at Ojai WordFest soon and I'm hoping my husband can hear you speak then.<br><br>

Many thanks for all the good work that you do, 
<b>Carolyn Moore Ojai, CA</b>

<b>“</b>Mr. Chambers, Every once in a while there’s a great article from the many trade magazines we get here, as was your recent article, “Fear Is Not A Growth Strategy”. You included some great facts and some great ideas. They’re many things in the article that I’ll do tonight so that we’ll begin to implement tomorrow.  In particular, I like the idea of tribes of people and how advisors seem to appear the same to the general public. <b>Kelli Waller CFA</b><br><br> 

<b>“</b>I loved Recondo and have added it to my special collection, which is why I tracked you down to ask for a signature. You did an incredible job of transporting me to Vietnam; it was like I was on patrol with you. It was one of those rare books that I just couldn’t put down and hated to finish. <b>Kevin Basnight</b><br><br>  

<b>“</b>Larry; I don’t know why other people hire you —But, I think the core reason I hire you is that you empower me and I always feel better about myself, my life, and my prospects after talking to you. I am not sure how you market that but I would argue that ability is far more important than teaching someone the mechanics of attraction marketing. Please understand that I am not denigrating attraction marketing. Rather, lam suggesting that your ability to empower is at the very heart of teaching someone how to do attraction marketing. Phrased another way — I think you have a unique ability to help people discover what about them can be made attractive. <b> J. Wayne Firebaugh Jr., CPA, CFP</b><br><br>

<b>“</b>Amazing! It’s rare that people who actually do things worth writing about actually write about them, and even rarer that they write about them well and usefully. My first writing teacher — the novelist Joyce Carol Oates — used to opine that this was the case because people who did things didn’t need to write about them. In any case, I’m very glad to have read it, and very glad to know you. One of my great regrets is that I never went into the service — knew how hard it would be, and academia is much easier, even though it frequently goes against my grain.
Thank you very much, <b> Pinckney Iowa Writers Professor</b><br><br>  

<b>“</b>Dear Mr. Chambers  I read all of your books. I just couldn’t believe you got back to me. For me it was like getting reply from Superman. I was raised on stories about Vietnam War and Army Rangers. Poland has always fought against communists, first in WWI than before WWII in 1939 and shortly after the war. There were some guerrilla forces fighting against Soviet Militia and NKVD. In 1956 there was a mutiny in Radom, hundreds of people got on the streets and fought hard against the government. In 1970 there were mutinies in Gdansk, Gdynia, Katowice and other cities. Many civilians died on the streets of Poland. In 1980 Soviet tanks were standing all over Poland,<br><br>

soldiers everywhere. It was like Northern Ireland here.  I will do whatever I can to make sure that people will not forget about you guys. Regards

<b>“</b>We began 2000 with approximately $1.9 billion in assets under management.  By 2005, that figure had grown to $11 billion and one year later we reached 20 billion.  Our marketing theme at Thornburg is to build product visibility, primarily by demonstrating value by educating advisors. We are a small mutual fund company located in Santa Fe, New Mexico, who has the same visibility of a much larger organization.  We have accomplished this by combining our internal marketing department and The Larry Chambers’ Credibility Marketing Program —writing articles and books directed to educate our market. I believe this is the secret to growth.

 <b>“</b>One of the most valuable experiences I’ve had in my professional life was to slow down, step back, and chart exactly where I am, where I’m going, what tools , techniques and processes I’m going to use to get there—and then lay it over a timeline: one year, three years, five years, 25 years, and life.  Without Larry’s help, I never would have taken the time to stop, think about it, map it and implement it—the conclusion of which is my book, Surviving the Storm, now in worldwide release.

<b>“</b>I've worked with Larry since my days as an editor at Financial Planning magazine in the mid-80s. I continued to work with him over the next 20 years or so, as a freelance writer when I went to Worth magazine and Dow Jones Investment Advisor. I've recommended Larry for numerous writing/consulting engagements such as with Thornburg Investment Management (where my marriage to one of Thornburg's partners disqualified me). Larry co-authored a number of books and articles for them, including the still highly regarded "Thornburg Guide to ERISA." He's a fine writer, whose real strength is a thorough understanding of the financial services industry and where various companies, products, and players fit into it. Larry's used this expertise to write and publish more than 50 books for his clients over the years. For senior corporate executives looking to brand their expertise and create substantial publicity while doing it, there's no better partner in the business than Larry Chambers.

<b>“</b>Larry was responsible for the placement of over 40 articles with me while at AEGON and TIAA-CREF which resulted in over 100 quotes in other articles and books.  His work led to the cover story of Financial Planning about the work we were doing at TIAA-CREF to develop the advisor business.  If you Google Michael Lane AEGON or Michael Lane TIAA-CREF most of the articles you will view were a result of Larry managing relationships on our behalf with industry media.  Larry has the ability to not just help in article writing and placement, but also direct media people to who they should speak with for quotes which created an image in the market, in less than 2 years, that AEGON was the thought leader in the annuity industry.  That has since waned… after I left and they went back to traditional advertising and marketing.

<b>“</b>After hearing Larry Chambers speak on PR, I put together a folder of articles, some I had written and some about me.  I now hand them to prospects when we first meet.  It takes me past the initial awkward phase of a first meeting.  Instead of me saying, ‘I’m an expert,’ the articles say it for me.  They become my credentials.  It really breaks the ice.

<b>“</b>In 1990 The Institute for Investment Management Consultants (IIMC) had less than 100 members.  Larry Chambers was hired to create a PR program. With the help of two simple Attraction Marketing tactics—writing a monthly column in a trade magazine, and a stay-behind-technique offering a free booklet—the organization’s membership swelled to over 2,000, with a prospect list of 10,000—all without spending a dime on advertising!  Before the Attraction Marketing program, no one had even heard of the Institute.

I just got through sharing with my husband what Mr. Chambers shared with us today. It felt like today was just for me....l hope that the rest of the class learned something as well but my goodness it was a definite eye opener for me. It was kind of scary being so vulnerable about this business with everyone listening but what a great teaching tool. I have always thought that whatever I do should be a help to others. If what I go through can’t help someone else, why do I go through it? So, I pray that the class learned something valuable today as I did. My goodness....such nuggets my cup is overflowing with the information he gave me today. Thanks again. You are amazing.<br>

<b>“</b>Larry I spoke with you yesterday by phone. I asked you about following the query letter inquiry in your book or following my instinct and sending a genuine complement to an editor for an article she wrote. You suggested the latter. I sent an email and made a few points about why I liked a specific article. Then mentioned I had a few ideas on future articles and requested a phone call to share some other feedback. She called me today and we discussed the article, the magazine’s vision and her start up struggles to get it up and going. She shared with me what she was trying to accomplish with its publication and that it had been a long time dream of hers. I offered myself as a resource for to network with people in my part of the state and she was thrilled. I also told her that if she ever needed to interview someone in my part of the state and was running behind a deadline, I would be glad to help. Then she asked if I could help her find someone to write a financial article each month. So after our 30 minute conversation today, not only will I get a shot at interviewing successful people for future articles in my target market, looks like I will also be writing a monthly column as well.

It would be incredibly helpful and we would be most appreciative. Many thanks Larry! <b> Jeanne Glasser</b> editor McGraw-Hill<br><br>
<b>“</b>I enjoyed your book so much I’ve decided to consider Financial Planning as a career. I’ve been a professional trader most of my adult life on the floor of US futures exchanges. I have many friends and contacts that have made significant amounts of money on the floor only to manage it poorly off the floor. The biggest trick to financial success on the trading floor is not to have a market opinion, unfortunately it doesn’t translate well off the floor. So after some bad experiences on their own they turn to a broker/salesman and get taken advantage of. Do have a recommendation for training resources for myself? <b> Jay Sidie</b><br><br>

<b>“</b>I just finished your excellent Roth 401(k) article in Financial Advisor. Thank you for sharing your insights. I have read probably a dozen articles on the Roth 401(k) and yours was by far the most comprehensive and useful. One question that I have, and may have just missed in the article, is whether a participant can withdraw contributions (as distinct from earnings) at any time without adverse tax consequences. If you have a moment to respond, I would be grateful. In any event, thank you again for sharing your expertise.<b> Steven M Sudeley </b>Financial Mgmt., LLC<br><br>

I just wanted to say thank you for all you did for our country.<br><br>

<b>“</b>Wow, talk about a butterfly effect! I love how willing to be of service you are to ‘really anyone that asks. Your honesty mixed with your experience is hard to forget, which means you stand out. to have experience in something is great, but to use it as a guide to helps others is even better, and what your doing is mixing that with the TRUTH which puts you in whole separate category of un-stoppable force! You kinda of remind me of this rhino I saw. it’s a large strong focused rhino running towards it’s goal.  I saw that and I thought of my dad.  I love you. I love you. I love you.<br><br>

<b>“</b>Dear Mr. Chambers - - - -I have always admired the country’s who “fought” the cold war....Here in Denmark we just <b>“</b>stayed low” and let NATO and the USA protect us, we even had the nerve to criticize the USA for fighting… In Denmark standing up for freedom is almost a dirty deed, sometimes l am ashamed of being Danish and that brings me to the point, you guy’s had to fight when you country asked, even when people was calling you baby killers and all that crap.  I also know that many Vietnam veterans have been given the shitty end of the stick many are dying like flies way to soon, and that makes me sad, no one should die of a horrible cancer age 50 because they at age 19 walked around in a jungle that has been sprayed with agent orange.

<b>“</b>Mr. Chambers, I’ve started this email a dozen times over the past few years and felt a little silly about seeming like a kook fan, but I lost my dad 27 Dec, 03 and decided this is really important. I want to thank you on behalf of those of us whom never could hear our fathers’ memories and stories from Viet Nam. Thank you for telling us about what you went through. About the life-long friends, the pain, the triumph. My dad could only speak of very minor things. Anything beyond generalizations would cause him a breakdown. He was a Marine. I did as much research about any places or names as he would say, but it isn’t much. He did some recon too, though that was not his MOS. I guess I’m saying that your story is his story. You may have been in different areas, seen different things. But your sacrifice is the same. Another reason that I want to thank you is that since my dad could never speak of his experiences, I could never speak of my experiences. He would be the only one who would understand and I could be safe to tell. I spent time in places in the late ‘80s that we (the US) were not supposed to be. My teammates went into memory on some missions and I cannot speak of their sacrifice. So, thank you Sergeant Chambers. I feel like I know all of you better than my dad. No more blah, blah, blah from me. <b>Michael Bolton Former</b> 3\502, 101 ARN member<br><br>

Larry: I enjoyed speaking with you and look forward to speaking with1 you again. I loved RECONDO and have added it to my special collection, which is why I tracked you down to ask for a signature. You did an incredible job of transporting me to Vietnam, it was like I was on patrol with you. Thank you for signing it for me. It was one of those rare books that I just couldn’t put down and hated to finish.  <b>Kevin Basnight Oxford,</b> NC<br><br>

Reviews Recondo: LRRPs in the 101st Airborne (Mass Market Paperback)<br><br>

<b>*****</b>COMPLETELY EXCELLENT......., July 3, 2009  Lathrop on Stuff  
Simply put, one of the best books I have ever read. The style is completely transparent...makes you feel like you know this guy very well and it puts you right there in the action with w complete suspension of disbelief. READ THIS BOOK.<br><br>

<b>*****</b>Remarkable Story With First-Rate Writing, May 27, 2009<br><br> 
	
Jonathan Nelson   - This review is from: Recondo: LRRPs in the 101st Airborne (Audio Cassette)  I have long been a fan of books about history and military conflicts. I like to listen to audiobooks in the car while shuttling the kids around to and from school, so I was pretty pleased when I found an audio version of Recondo for cheap.   The content of the book is not a surprise. Recondo is the author's account of serving with a Long Range Recon unit during the Vietnam War. The book covers his experiences in the<br><br> 

military from enlisting to going his experiences after the war. For others that have read other books about LRRPs, Recondo starts roughly about the same time as "Eyes of the Eagle" by Gary Linderer ends. Both authors served in the same unit, so if you have read Gary Linderer's books, there may be a bit of overlap.<br><br>  

<b>“</b>What I did find surprising in this book is the author's ability to tell a story. In my opinion, Mr. Chambers is an extremely talented storyteller. Throughout the entire book, I felt as if I were there. His writings made me feel the excitement of battle, the fear of being the new guy and doing nothing right, and the dejection that came with no one seeming to care about the fact he made it home. Throughout the entire book, I felt as if I were sitting in the backyard with a beer, taking face to face with the author, watching the sunset with some steaks searing away on the grill.<br><br>  

I particularly enjoyed the ending of the book. I like to read about the military and war. I am fascinated with the stories of the people who have served our fine nation, not really the blood and guts aspect. At the end of the book, the author discusses his return home. I found a scene that he described at a party particular disturbing, as it seemed no one cared about the fact this fine young man just came back from serving his country. It offered a glimpse of an aspect of war not covered by many books.<br><br>  

The narrator of the audiobook, Brian Hallas, was an excellent choice. This deep, gravelly voice gave the feel of a story being told by an old, battle seasoned Sergeant. Personally, I would have paid twice as much for an unabridged version of this story.   Overall, this is one of the two best books I have heard/read on the Vietnam War. The author is a talented writer. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone interested.<br><br> 

<b>*****</b>A Great Read, November 1, 2008  L. Schaefer  One of the best reads I've had in a while. Excitement and drama in every chapter. Unexpected chills and thrills also. I did not want to put the book down. Most of the training that was covered had to do with on the job training, which was the most dangerous. From ambushes to booby traps to the unexpected, this book had it all. It makes you appreciate the job previous and current armed forces personnel have done for this country.<br><br> 

<b>“</b>Mr. Chambers- What excites me about your ideas is that through focusing we have been able to write articles and speak across the world...l feel like we know the benefit of focusing our marketing.  Look forward to your future articles and I’ll probably pick up a book or two. Regards, <b> Kyle Waller</b> Research Analyst Wiser Wealth Managemen.<br><br>
