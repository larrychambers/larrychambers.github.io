Betrayal of Vietnam 1945 solves one the great mysteries of the 21st century and explains why we were really there.  This is a story about one man’s quest to find the truth. It is also the story about the discovery of America’s hidden historical events that took place in Vietnam in 1941-45 but were hidden from public view and the consequences were experienced twenty years later resulting in the Vietnam War.

Central to this story is Ho Chi Minh, revered by his countrymen, reviled by the French and Americans.  And perhaps to solve the puzzle that has troubled him for forty years, who really started the Vietnam War and why?   His journey uncovers a shameful truth of a lost opportunity, drowned in European imperial hubris, and the Cold War, and the betrayal of the promise to hold democratic elections in the south, and the new imperial power, the United States, that threw its youth and treasure into the maw of a brutal war against a people defending their own land.

The story begins on a journey to Thailand where the author is challenged to defend his firm conviction about the war he fought in decides to return to Vietnam to confirm that he’s right.  But instead he finds distortions in our history, myths created by the French about the Vietnamese and practically everything else he once believed as the truth about Vietnam, the people and the war was a lie.

That Ho Chi Minh had been America’s ally in fighting the Japanese forces during the Second World War and was being prepared to play a key part in the invasion of Japan had it taken place.

The last part of the book is about the Perfidy of Cambodia documenting the events leading up to America’s war with Vietnam and Nixon’s irresponsible reasoning behind the US bombing of Cambodia.  During his journey in Cambodia the author catches a glimpse of his true nature; the person who is compassionate, kind and carrying which were the very traits he had been hiding from the outside world.  With his belief system shaken he returns home and is confronted by shallow and bias thinking friends who had no interest in what he had found and disregard his new way of being.  They could not accept that the author had made some fundamental changes. Instead his friends wanted him to return to his old self.

The book is a mythic travelogue of soul-searching and self-discovery which ends by the author retuning to help the people he had harmed. In the end he finds salvation and redemption.
