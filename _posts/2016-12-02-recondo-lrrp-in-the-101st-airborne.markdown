Author Larry Chambers vividly describes the guts and courage it took to pass the though volunteer-only training program in Nha Tarng to be part of the 5th Special Forces Recondo School, the hair-raising graduation mission to scout out, locate, and out-guerilla the NVA. Here is an unforgettable account that follows Chambers and the Rangers every step of the way--from joining, going through Recondo, and finally leading his own team on white-knuckle missions through the jungle hell of Vietnam. Recondo, was the subject of a History Channel television special.  

What most distinguished the Special Forces Recondo School from any other in the history of the American military was its final exam -- a reconnaissance mission deep within enemy territory, miles from friendly ground troops, and with absolutely no support.  It was a trial by fire, where students were sometimes wounded or killed.  That’s how Recondo School got its reputation as the “deadliest school on earth”.
