    "description": "His portrayal of a trooper helping a wounded enemy soldier to Medivac helicopter. Operation Nevada Eagle began on May 17, 1968 the Screaming Eagles of the 1st and 2nd Brigades had a new mission. The VC and NVA in the area badly needed the rice from the upcoming harvest. Working in coordination with the district chiefs, the brigades protected the villagers as they harvested their spring rice.  At 12:30 a.m. on May 21, 1968 an NVA battalion, augmented by personnel from a sapper demolition team, launched a daring ground attack against Camp Eagle, following a covering barrage of more than 400 rounds of 122mm rockets, 82mm mortars, B-40 and B-41 rocket-grenades into the Division headquarters area. The ground attack struck the southwest edge of the perimeter and was beaten back by headquarters troops of the 1st Brigade, members of the 2nd Bn., 502nd Abn Inf., and helicopter gunships.  At dawn a sweep of the area revealed 54 enemy bodies and 16 individual weapons captured",
