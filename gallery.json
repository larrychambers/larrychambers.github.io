Working in coordination with the district chiefs, the brigades protected the villagers as they harvested their spring rice.  At 12:30 a.m. on May 21, 1968 an NVA battalion, augmented by personnel from a sapper demolition team, launched a daring ground attack against Camp Eagle, following a covering barrage of more than 400 rounds of 122mm rockets, 82mm mortars, B-40 and B-41 rocket-grenades into the Division headquarters area. The ground attack struck the southwest edge of the perimeter and was beaten back by headquarters troops of the 1st Brigade, members of the 2nd Bn., 502nd Abn Inf., and helicopter gunships.

Tight security ringed the planning stages of the operation. Artillery preparations were halted one week prior to the operation. Aerial reconnaissance missions over the area were also curtailed during the days preceding the assault. To further tighten the secrecy, the command post CP was not to be moved to firebase Brick until the day of the operation. The 1st Bn., 508th Abn. Inf., were air-assaulted to the pre-planned landing zones.  The first heavy contact came on the second day of the operation when a platoon from Co. B overran a deserted enemy base camp. So surprised were the former occupants that they left their noon meal simmering in cooking pots. The platoon leader sent a recon squad downstream from his position to investigate a possible enemy hiding spot. The squad immediately came under intense fire from a concentration of enemy automatic weapons. The remainder of the platoon maneuvered to develop the contact. The platoon leader gave the order to fix bayonets and charged the enemy’s position. The element of surprise belonged to the Airborne as they overran the hostile position, killing 13 NVA regulars. As the paratroopers continued their pursuit, they came under heavy automatic weapons, B-40, and RPG-7 rocket fire.  The American’s pulled back and built a makeshift camp to allow air strikes to soften the area.",
